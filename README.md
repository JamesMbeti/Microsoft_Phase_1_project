## MICROSOFT'S NEW MOVIE STUDIO ANALYSIS
<img src = "/images/movie.jpg"/>
Everyone loves a good movie! From animated classics to franchise action movies, movies appeal to many different groups of people and offer wonderful escapes from reality.

We therefore want to figure out what exactly makes a movie a “success”, through analysis so that we can narrow down to some common factors in successful movies. 

This will in turn be of key value in making strategic decisions for our studio regarding production and financing.

#### The Optimal Genres?
All this movies getting produced comprise of different genres ranging from action, comedy, drama,etc, just to name a few.

But what genres makes a movie succesful?

We've collected data from various platforms to analyze and find out the best performing genres at the box office which we can in turn incorporate them into our new movie studio decison making process for the best performing film genres which we can create. 

#### ANALYSIS
I will be performing an analysis on over 2,500 movies. The data includes different information concerning the movies ranging from the title, genres, averagerating, e.t.c

I will be analyzing the dataset to determine what contributes to the "success" of a movie. In this analysis I will define success in financial terms basing the success of a movie on whether it made twice or more as much money as the budget.

We will find out what succesful movies have in common through graphic representatioms done through python.

### The Data

In the folder data are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

#### DATA ANALYSIS
Through the analysis the findings were that Genres; Drama, Comedy and Thriller are the most specific common genres in all successful movies and also in the Top 100. Drama being the most common.

Average rating doesn't affect the success of a movie in terms of the income generated as there is no correlation between the average rating and the income ratio.

The movie release month is also key in terms of the income to be generated and should be intentional. The following shows the best months which averaged best in the icome generated.

There is much more to the analysis which could be found in this [Student.ipynb File](https://github.com/JamesMbeti/Microsoft_phase_1_project/blob/master/student.ipynb) and a [Presentation pdf](https://github.com/JamesMbeti/Microsoft_phase_1_project/blob/master/presentation.pdf) is also available which led to some of the following conclusions.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS

1) With the findings I highly recommend three film genres which include: **_DRAMA, THRILLER and COMEDY_** which appeared to be the most common genres in succesful movies. **DRAMA** with the highest priority as it is cheaper to produce and has a high income ratio. 

2) The sucess of a movie also highly depends on the release month. I'd also want to recommend three months which proved best in terms of the income generated. They include: **_JULY, JANUARY and NOVEMBER_** with **JULY** having the highest income ratio.

3) I would recommend a budget allocation **within 24 million dollars** which proved to be a good allocation for a successful movie considering the inverse relationship between the budget and the income ratio.
